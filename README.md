# Pink Spring Theme
A base theme and plugins based off Spring Theme and ACF with major support for Gutenberg/Block Editor
Also supports WooCommerce, Gravity Forms, and The Events Calendar

### Pink Spring Theme
Build off of [Spring Theme](https://github.com/3themes/spring-theme), which is based on an older version of the modular [Roots/Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) templating system.

Updates for modular styles, typographic consideration, general fixes and WordPress standards. And of course, a better color scheme.

Support for my [Site Customizer](https://github.com/marktimemedia/mtm-site-customizer) and [ACF Block Components](https://github.com/marktimemedia/acf-component-blocks) plugins built in!
